# Cosmos / Tendermint "Things to know"
The cosmos main net is a master class in bad naming.
The primary repo (https://github.com/cosmos/mainnet) is called Gaia.
The network has the currency $ATOM
The mainnet has a chain-id of cosmoshub-4
And is generally called the hub.

So if you hear these things, that is what they refer to.
